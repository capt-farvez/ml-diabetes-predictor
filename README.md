# ML Diabetes Predictor
A simple machine learning web application for predicting the likelihood of diabetes based on user-provided health data. Built using Flask for the backend and a Random Forest model trained on Diabetes Dataset.

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates how a machine learning model can be integrated into a web app. Users can enter their medical details (e.g., glucose level, BMI, age) and receive an instant prediction of whether they are likely to have diabetes.

## Features
- Clean HTML form to input health metrics
- Backend built with Flask
- Random Forest model for prediction
- Lightweight UI with customizable styles

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS
- **Backend**: Flask
- **Machine Learning**: scikit-learn (Random Forest)
- **Data Processing**: pandas, NumPy
